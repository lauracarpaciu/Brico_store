Steps I've applied for this project:

Excel data analysis:

Excel Functions :

the VLOOKUP which returns values in the column: "Marca proprie";

the IF function which returns values based on a true or false condition ;

the COUNTIF function which counts cells based on the values stored on the column "Interval Cifra de afaceri";

the AND function which returns TRUE if all prices are equal, else returns FALSE;

PivotTable which organizes and analyzes data regarding CA / raion;

POWER BI :

MAX and MIN of CA group by column "Denumire raion";

SUM of CA group by column "Denumire raion";

AVERAGE group by column "Denumire raion";

COUNT how many products are maintaining the price unchanged, and how many are not;

SUM of CA group by the column "Marca Proprie";

After data set exploration I have to say that:

goods named "Fără marcă" are the most numberest;

goods with "CA sub 10.000 lei" are the most present;

the price for most of the products rests unchanged;

the raion "GRADINA" has the 24% from CA.
